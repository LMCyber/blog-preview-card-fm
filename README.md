## My process

I started by centering all the content of the body and then styling it. I used grid to center and flex to organize the authorâ€™s section.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use Grid to center content from the beginning.

```css
.body {
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```
